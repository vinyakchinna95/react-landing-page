📌 Understanding React Components
In this project, I explored the React component-based architecture, which helps in:

Reusability – Components like Navbar, Hero, and Footer can be reused across multiple pages.
Maintainability – Code is modular and easy to manage.
Separation of Concerns – Each component handles a specific part of the UI.
